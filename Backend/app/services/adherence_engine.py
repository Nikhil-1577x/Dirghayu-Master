adherence_engine.py – Core adherence classification logic.

Rules (TASK 1 — exact thresholds, applied consistently):
  TAKEN  – dose event received within ±30 minutes of scheduled time
  LATE   – dose event received between 30 minutes and 2 hours of scheduled time
  MISSED – no dose event received after the 2-hour window has passed

Drug holiday – zero activity across ALL compartments for 18 consecutive hours → URGENT alert.
Weekly score  – (taken / total) * 100

TIMING NOTE: Scheduled datetime is anchored to the event's OWN calendar date,
not today's date. This is critical for historical seed data and past records
to be classified correctly regardless of when classify_dose() is called.
